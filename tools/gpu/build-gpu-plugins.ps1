    build-gpu-plugins.ps1 — build the per-vendor GPU plugin DLLs on Windows
    (Phase 3, the Windows twin of tools/linux/build-gpu-plugins.sh).

    The CPU-safe main app (built with WFS_GPU_PLUGINS) LoadLibrary's these at
    runtime per the user-selected device; the app itself links no GPU runtime.

    Builds whichever toolchains are present:
        wfs_cuda.dll   (NVIDIA/CUDA)  — needs the CUDA Toolkit (cl.exe + CUDA_PATH)
        wfs_hip.dll    (AMD/HIP)      — needs the AMD HIP SDK for Windows (hipcc)

    Besides the plugin DLLs, this stages the CUDA runtime DLLs the cuda plugin
    loads at runtime (CUDA Runtime + NVRTC) next to it, so a machine with only the
    NVIDIA driver (no CUDA toolkit) still gets GPU acceleration. The app/installer
    then ship the plugins + those runtime DLLs from this one dir.

    Usage (from a "x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS" / Developer PowerShell):
        tools\windows\build-gpu-plugins.ps1 [-OutDir <dir>]
    OutDir defaults to Builds\VisualStudio2022\x64\Release\App (beside the .exe,
    where GpuBackendFactory dlopens the plugins and the installer collects them).

    NOTE: untested in CI — validate on a real Windows + toolkit setup.

# compiled strings (CudaWfsKernels.h et al.), so there is NO device code to
# compile here -- exactly like the CUDA branch above builds host code with
# cl.exe, not nvcc. Do NOT use hipcc: it forces `-x hip` (device) compilation,
# and on Windows that pulls HIP's device-math headers (__clang_hip_cmath.h)
# whose isgreater/isless/... overloads collide with MSVC <cmath>'s
# _CLANG_BUILTIN2(...) and fail to build. (On Linux hipcc works because
# libstdc++'s <cmath> doesn't clash.) So compile as host C++ with the SDK's
# clang++ (-x c++), define __HIP_PLATFORM_AMD__ so <hip/hip_runtime.h> exposes
# the host API, and link amdhip64 (HIP runtime) + hiprtc (runtime kernel
# compiler). -fms-runtime-lib=dll is the clang spelling of /MD (shared dynamic
# CRT, see above). Resolve the SDK root from HIP_PATH (set by the HIP SDK shell)
# or from hipcc's own location; the app is expected to run from a Developer
